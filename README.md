# MaleX

_MaleX_ is a curated dataset of malware and benign Windows executable samples for malware researchers. The dataset contains 1,044,394 Windows executable binaries and corresponding image representations with 864,669 labelled as malware and 179,725 as benign. This dataset has reasonable number of samples and is sufficient to test data-driven machine learning classification methods and also to measure the performance of the designed models in terms of scalability and adaptability.

## Malware Visualization in Frequency Domain

The motivation to visualize malware in frequency domain is because of the "sparse" feature representations of malware in literature that are typically extracted from raw bytes of the binaries or disassembled instructions (n-grams, n-perms).

A given executable binary file is read as a 16-bit signed hexadecimal vector and divided into corresponding bi-grams (n-grams of bytes with n=2). As an example, for the byte-stream _0a1bc48a_, the corresponding bi-grams will be _0a1b_, _1bc4_ and _c48a_. We then use the bi-gram frequency count to get a sparse image of dimensions 256x256 (where each pixel intensity value corresponds to normalized frequency count of a particular bi-gram). The image dimensions is the primary reason for choosing bi-grams (n=2) as it aids image-based machine learning classification with low time complexity in the training phase. Finally, we compute the full frame Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) of this image to de-sparsify and get a resulting "bigram-dct" image with distinctive textured patterns. Before normalizing frequency count to get the sparse image, we zero out the first frequency count value corresponding to the bi-gram _0000_, as this value is relatively very large compared to that of other bi-grams and the bi-gram either corresponds to empty space or new line(s) in the code with no useful information. The overview of the proposed feature extraction method is shown below.

## Comparing Malware Visualization Methods

Previous research has shown that malware variants belonging to the same family exhibit visual similarity in the byteplot images. These are based on visualization of malware binaries in the spatial domain by converting bytes to pixels. The frequency domain-based visualization is another such "orthogonal" depiction of malware binary that is shown (in our paper, [Malware Detection Using Frequency Domain-Based Image Visualization and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10578)) to aid computer vision algorithms to detect malware. The comparison of the byteplot and "bigram-dct" representations is shown in the figure below.
